        Hi, I like to make Origami.
It is a hobby of mine, I have been making origami since I was little. I usually do it in my free time.
    </p>
    
       <p>
I hope to make more and more creations    </p>

            <p>
                There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.
